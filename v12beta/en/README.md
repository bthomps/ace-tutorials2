# Toolkit Tutorials page

Clone the repo

`npm i` to install dependencies

`npm run build` to build the tutorials page. The Tutorials page will then be within the `build` folder which you can copy.

Things fixed:
- Fixed image display: https://github.ibm.com/Cloud-Integration/toolkit-tutorials/issues/13
- Attempt at setting javaSetSelectedTutorialFunction to empty on backToGallery
